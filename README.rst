Torndb
======

Fork from https://github.com/bdarnell/torndb (not actively maintained)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the origin package(github.com/bdarnell/torndb)is not support Python 3
and it is not actively maintained.
the original author said that he do not intend to make major changes or merge pull requests.
I fork it and ported it to Python 3.

in Tornado (http://www.tornadoweb.org).  It is being moved into
a separate package for Tornado 3.0.

``pip install git+https://github.com/hanjm/torndb``

Documentation
